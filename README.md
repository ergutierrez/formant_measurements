# Formant Measurements
This repository contains code for a complete program that obtains formant values (mean and mid-point) for the first 4 formants of any vowel (the example displayed here shows the vowel "i").

## NB
The vowel formant function, in its own right, may be of particular interest. It was designed using the [Parselmouth](https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/parselmouth/latest/parselmouth.pdf) and [audiolabel](https://github.com/rsprouse/audiolabel) packages. Refer to Ronald Sprouse's audiolabel repository on Github for further information on how to implement these packages and create dataframes with acoustic measurements.
